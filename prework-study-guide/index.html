        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, content is contained between an opening tag and closing tag.</li>
          <li>Children elements are elements that are nested inside other elements, or parent elements.</li>
          <li>Elements and tags are used interchangeably in the developer world. However, element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle (<>) brackets.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements indicate the role of their content and gives structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how mcuh space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside tan element.</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal stylesheet, and external stylesheet.</li>
          <li>The most common is external stylesheet: which allows delevopers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>When using an external stylesheet, we link the file using a <link> element placed in the HTML <head>.</li>
          <li>* = a wild card symbol, which is used when you want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the webpage.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code: group two or more elements together by using a comma rather than repeating a rule.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: pulls the lastest version of the project on your local computer, making sure the local branach has synced with the remote base branch.</li>
